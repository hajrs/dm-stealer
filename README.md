# Misa-DMAFirmware-Stealer

**Created By Kaii**

Wrote this due to a firmware seller being a idiot about stealing firmware. Go wild.

## Features:

- Copys all .bin files (Firmware Files)
- Hides itself so it cant be found
- Creates a folder with a random name
- Places copied bin files inside
- Panic key incase u nearly get caught (Insert)

## How To Use:

- Place `Misa-DMAFirmware-Stealer.exe` in a random folder inside of **Random Windows Folder** then run it. When it asks if you want to hide it, type "yes". it will disappear.
- Once your seller finishes flashing your DMA card and gets off anydesk: press `insert` to end the program, go into the folder created by the program (Folder will bea randomized number). Inside you will find all .bin files.
- Search the name of your firmware sellers .bin file and boom! you have their .bin file.
**Example** path: `C:\Windows\System32\icsxml`

### Warning!
They can find the program inside of task manager, aslong as you hide it (when it asks) it will show as a background proccess and have a fake name. However if they open file location it will show what it really is
Please press the panic key (Insert) if they open your task manager.

*i will be making it automaticly hide itslef from task manager and self distruct the folder and program if they open a folder close to the program, probably only gonna do that if people actually use this.*
